A difficult part of any build process can be choosing the correct answers.  Here are the correct answers:
:: fakeroot-tcp and fakeroot are in conflict. Remove fakeroot? [y/N] y
Tap the 'y' key first, then enter.  For the first question, the 'y' key must be tapped first, then enter.  Yes will be chosen when enter is tapped in all of the questions after the first question:
:: Proceed with installation? [Y/n]
Tap enter twice more as this build proccess continues.  If everything goes well, you will see these messages:
Libraries have been installed in:
The message above will be displayed for a short time with more information.  Then setupTermuxArch.sh will go on, and there will be one more tap enter yo touch before script setupTermuxArch.sh is done;  SLEEPING SIX SECONDS...
makefakeroottcp 2.0.593: DONE üèÅ
Then this process will go on to try to make 'yay' which is much simpler for the user;  There is no tapping yes enter needed to be done whatsoever."
